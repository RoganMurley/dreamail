## Responsive email just got a whole lot easier

Writing an HTML email is a horrible experience. Standards are a joke, features we take for granted are missing and everything is a hack. With new email clients on the block things are only getting worse. Enter **dreamail**.

## What is it?

It's an email markup language that compiles to HTML. It takes care of the nasty bits; you won't even know the tables, conditionals and inline styles are there. It only supports what's proven to work. It's also very strict. With how sensitive these clients are, there's no room for error.

## Does it work yet?

Hold your horses, it's being prototyped right now. Initial results are encouraging.
